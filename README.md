This Python-based to-do list application is a versatile and user-friendly tool designed to help you manage your tasks and stay organized. It implements various programming concepts and best practices to ensure code quality, robust functionality, and a smooth user experience.

Features:

Retry Mechanism: The code includes a custom retry operation function that allows for transient error handling, making it more resilient to network issues or external service interruptions.

Memento Pattern: The Memento design pattern is used to capture and restore the state of tasks, providing a simple way to undo changes and revert to previous task states.

Builder Pattern: The Builder pattern is utilized for creating tasks with optional attributes such as due dates, priorities, and tags. This ensures flexibility while maintaining code readability.

Task Properties: Each task in the to-do list can have properties like due date, priority level (High, Medium, Low), and tags. Tags are used to categorize tasks for easy filtering and organization.

Tag Handling: Tasks can have multiple tags associated with them. You can add, remove, and list tags for each task, allowing for detailed categorization and filtering.

User Interface: The command-line interface provides a simple and intuitive way to interact with the application. Users can add, edit, mark tasks as completed, delete tasks, and view tasks based on different filter options.

Filtering: Users can filter tasks by showing all tasks, completed tasks, or pending tasks, making it easy to focus on what's relevant.

Exception Handling: The code implements comprehensive exception handling to provide meaningful error messages and gracefully recover from errors.

Logging: Logging mechanisms are in place to track errors and relevant information, ensuring transparency and aiding in debugging.

Input Validation: Robust input validation is performed at all levels to prevent invalid data from causing issues and to maintain data integrity.
